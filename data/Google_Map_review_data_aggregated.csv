Not Tesla. Which is ok, everyone should probably carry an adapter to connect to either one. $3/hour is not the best price, but the charger seems fast. Required downloading a new app (to me at least) called AmpUp. An old-fashioned gasoline f150 was parked in the spot, but the cord is long enough to reach me in the next spot over. There is also a NEMA 14-50r four prong plug. That one appears to be free(!?) for hotel guests.Does not exist anymore! The Tesla destination chargers were replaced with JuiceBar chargers that use AmpUp to charge you. They have J1772 plugs and charge at 10kW. The current rate is $3/hour plus taxes, fees, and idle fees ($5/hour starting 30 minutes after charging finishes). Max allowed charging time is 4 hours. Then you have to go unplug and plug back in to start a new session. The NEMA 14-50 and NEMA 5-20 (120v) outlets are still there if you have your UMC on you. The two times I used the 14-50 outlets, I had to turn on the circuit breakers in the breaker panel not too far away. There are three charger plugs and three outlets of each that reach four parking spaces, although a couple of spots were usually ICE’d. I recommend bringing your J1772 adapter if you plan to use the charger, and also bringing your Mobile Connector with a 14-50 adapter if you don’t feel like going through the trouble of dealing with AmpUp and needing to reconnect after 4 hours.At this time only one charger works and it’s always a gamble for a spot due to ICE vehicles parking there.Nice family stay at the HGI. I counted eight Tesla Chargers. Most of time six or seven were iced. They all have Tesla signs marking them.

Why is it so difficult for the charging to begin?Tried to figure out how to use it. Downloaded the app, signed up, linked a credit card. Scanned the qr code, finally got it connected, plugged it in. Said charger fault on my f150 Lightning, tried three of them, all didn't work.

In short, the charger itself is fine, the businesses surrounding the chargers aren't thrilled about it.Area is full of restaurants from Starbucks to Chipotle to Applebees.

The charger was in good working order and there was no one else there.  When I got home I signed up for an account, which is free. In my area it costs about $0.35 per minute for the DC fast charge with no monthly charges.

But man, if you don't have a house or are traveling, it's rough. Charged here a few times and it is hit or miss if the Ford app knows if a charger is being used or not. And when you get there, the not sure, tends to be down. Today, it was down sort of... charging slow??? Like 30 instead of the usual 100+ I usually get. It was complimentary session which is great and all, but twenty minutes and only went from 3% to 20.... and it should be full of taking everything that can be thrown at it when the battery is that low and not throttled. I still search for Electrify America chargers because I connect my car, and it works without me further interacting. No other charger has I got to do that even though Ford says the other ones should. So.... they are doing some things right.Very inconvenient and waste of time! Called regarding slow speed multiple times and they don’t care to fix the issue nor reflect it on the app that charging speed is slow or if the chargers are not working all together.  Shame on you, guys!!!!! Giving electric cars a bad name and making it an inconvenience to own one!!!!Upgraded CCS charging station are good. Has 6 parking space but only 4 usable space because of the placement of the stations.Easy to use, large crisp display, simple GUI controls for starting the charge process on the CHAdeMO quick charger, and conveniently located within a short walk to Walmart or a gas station convenience store.

Today we were waiting behind 3 other vehicles waiting to charge and it added nearly two hours to our trip.They have upgraded this place, so it works a lot better than the old units. I'm giving it 4 stars only because it worked at the time I was there. Unfortunately, Electrify America is the only game in town as far as fast chargers go, so we don't really have a choice. Hopefully, as the infrastructure gets better, the service will get better. As for now, this is all we have.

However, it is the only one that serves the North Houston area  on I45 (the woodlands, spring,Conroe) and is not enough. Lately, I have found it is pretty packed and have to wait for 3 or 4 vehicles ahead of me.  Each vehicle takes at the very least 20 min, that is a minimum of 1 hr to be able to use it.  Also don’t understand why other non-EV vehicles are allowed to circulate in and out through the stations. They use it as a short cut to the gas station next to it, making traffic and overall circulation more difficult.Tesla really needs to invest into a new charging station north of Houston I-45 between Huntsville and this location, maybe Conroe/Woodlands will be ideal.

EV map was showing Most fast charging stations  located near by downtown and Round Rock.  Me and my husband from west central Texas(lil over 3hrs away from Austin),and we wasn't sure where to find a fast charging station for our 2020 Kia Niro EV.  Luckily, we found this spot but EV map wasn't showing a whole lot a details. Whether it has CHAdeMO, CCS.and J1772.  Soon as we were at this location,  OMG , I see the FAST charging station and nobody wasn't using at the time. There is  only 2 fast charging tower and 1 of tower wasn't available.  Luckily next to other charging tower was work.  We used CCS charger.  Before we put on charger, we only had a 39% power left on our car. We put on charger about less than 40 minutes later, it was 90% full.  This is just reminder,  with CCS charger battery wont charging a 100%. I do not know why they capped at 90% but, yeah 90% is  max capped. It wont let you charging any further. So if you want to charge your battery for 100%, you have to switch to CHAdeMO for rest of 10%.  0.21 cents per kw, yeah, it was little higher than where my husband went to last time. (Last time he went to Walmart EV charging station and their rate was 0.12 cents per kw. And this was only about 3 or 4 month ago). I guess because it located at right by airport  that maybe the reason why its pricey on this charging station.  Oh also,  at this location,  they have WHATABURGER, Subway, TEXACO gas station,  and few other convenient shop at same shopping center.  I just hope they have more than 2 CCS and CHAdeMO fast charging station.One station has painters tape on it saying it doesn't accept payment so we tried the other one.  It wouldn't initiate with the Chargepoint app so we tried with Apple pay.  That worked but it wanted me to acknowledge that I wasn't using a membership and the touch screen doesn't work well so I had to randomly press around on the screen until I luckily got it to register that I accepted the fact that I was just paying with a credit cardWhoever put this station in Rocks!  Next door to airport parking lots and a coffee shop.  Great for that little bit of power you need to get home.Great place to wait when you are picking up and you are right there at the terminals. Very nice and clean inside if you need food or drink. Can buy gas while waiting.  Its the best of both worlds.  Too bad other airports don't have a brain to do this.  Oh and you dont have to pay just to come and drop off or pick up. The days of DFW Airport are gone. It is totally worth the drive if you are even a little closer to that ridiculous DFW. No tolls to get here and no pay every time you have to drop off someone and go back to pick up. You can buy a meal for what you have to pay to get to and in DFW. Bergstrom International hands down an awesome airport. Im thrilled we are 24 minutes closer but I would go to Bergstrom if it was further wayCool little place to charge your electric cars, before a long trip after an airport ride, pick up a couple of snacks at the corner store, or the joining Whataburger.",4.2

Super busy Sunday afternoon but well organized and can look worse than it is getting in and out. Best bathrooms on the road anywhere.If you've never been to buc-ee's then you're in for an experience with the busiest service station I've ever been in. This time was my first time going and have never been in such a huge gas station, Tesla supercharge spot, and souvenir shop all-in-one. The restroom lines were a little long but the restroom attendants kept everything moving swiftly so the lines went down pretty quickly. Also the cashiers are swift and plentiful to make it easier getting checked out with ease. It is definitely a tourist spot and a place where you can grab a quick bite while on the road. They have different types of sandwiches, salads, tacos, burritos, and sweet treats made up and ready to grab.I must confess to being a major fan of Buc'ees. That did, this is the best Supercharger anywhere, in my opinion. Buc'ees is a logical pick. Their restroom facilities are the cleanest in the industry & never closed or out of order. They always have an ample selection of food & drinks. If you need to buy a gift for someone on the way, they are the logical choice. I hope Tesla adds Superchargers at EVERY Buc'ees in the near future.We didnt have issues with charges being blocked, but the parking lot was empty on the days we were there.

Conveniently located next to Hampton Inn if you want to spend the night. Charging tops out at 150kw. Looks very clean and safe.Nice, clean, and relatively fast charging. Looks like a safe place to charge at night as well. There were three Teslas including mine at the time of this review. It was a nice sunny day so my dog and I walked around the hotel a few times to stretch out a bit. Didn't need to use the restroom so I'm not sure what the hotel bathrooms are like. Cell reception (att) is solid with 5g and full bars.Very disappointed.  We’ve utilized this location multiple times with good results.  Today, after a long haul from Las Cruces, NM, we rolled in near empty on charge.  We hopped out to use the Hampton Inn restrooms as we’ve always done only to be confronted by an employee who said we could not use the restrooms and hung a sign stating they were “not available”.  No amount of discussion with four different Tesla drivers would deter him from his position.  Why would a business who agreed to this charging point and who allows advertisement of public restrooms allow this?If I could give it a ZERO star rating I would’ve.  This was the closest charging spot in 2 hours. Advertises restroom facilities at the hotel. Was not able to use it, as staff would not allow it. Very unfriendly. Very rude. And overall not a great experience.This supercharger is at the Hampton Inn. They don’t mind you going in to buy snacks from them, but they won’t allow you to use their restrooms. The man working the desk was so unbelievably rude when we used the restrooms and told us not to come back.",2.6

Usually blocked by other non EV cars.I’ve been trying to stay at this hotel, as it has 2 Tesla destination chargers, however; I have driven by on several occasions, only to find that these parking spots have been taken. I noticed neon traffic cones adjacent to the chargers (not in the actual parking space), and the chargers are locked (I’m ok with this, as they have a sign stating, guests are to ask personnel to unlock for charging. Curious why they would have cones stacked and not used, for the apparent purpose of leaving these parking spots vacant. When I called to inquire about my situation, I was told that the cords reach up to four parking spaces. I am not disagreeing with this, as I have not put this to the test, but it seemed within reason, however; all four spots were taken on two occasion, by non-Tesla vehicles (or any EV for that matter). I was also told the hotel was at capacity; at capacity did not seem sufficient enough when there was about 10 parkings available. I get the fact that the parking for destination charging was slightly closer than the vacant parkings, due to all rooms being booked. If people are booking rooms, whether it be personal or business, I would think that those who have limited resources for tier 2 charging in Sierra Vista would get some preference over someone who wants to park 10-20 feet closer to the hotel, when there is a gas station less than a 1/2 mile away.  The individual Monica was very pleasant and understanding on the phone.  Not sure if this hotel gets make and model color when checking in; This could easily remedy the situation by contacting the guests at some point. Using the cones would be my first option though…Yeah only for guests. I offered to purchase something from the hotel but they still deny even if the value of the item was more than the time spent charging. Like a bottle of wine for $30 from the lobby. Why are these even marked as available?Only available to guests. Parking is not enforced so has cars were blocking both stations.",1.25

I work in Midland often so this stop is a must. Good charging speeds (141 almost every time). Well lit and open by the road so feels pretty safe.Fantastic & a VERY CONVENIENT location!!  As with most Tesla superchargers stations, they’re primarily located on interstates & typically near next truckstops and small hotels.  For those traveling on “the 10/20,” this provides a good midpoint, particularly if you’re driving long distance. Of course, there are other MULTIPLE stations (plural) whether driving East or West: b/t Midland and Dallas, -OR- Midland and El Paso.  While I have certainly no complaints about this “standard 8 charging ports” station, the only “con“ that is applicable is that while road improvements are certainly a good thing, the city of Midland is currently doing extensive road construction at this intersection & for a very, very long time. The last few times I’ve been here, this relatively important intersection has been continually down to ‘ONE LANE’ in ALL directions so allow for a little more time going “to & fro.”  Additionally, it would be nice if TESLA had a station in Odessa on 20 as well but such has yet to be implemented.  However, a Tesla technician tell me, roughly 4 & 1/2 yrs ago - that Midland actually had this Tesla supercharger station installed ”early in” -  [even] B4 San Antonio ever had ONE (U can imagine the bureaucratic “red tape” involved in any EV installation) of these convenient stations due to many factors….so this speaks well of the city of Midlands willingness for innovation & growth!  Little Info: “Very Versed” in EVs (I’ve been the owner of 4 EVs since 2013 - 2023; a decade).  IF U have ANY questions in regards such (driving an EV is different in regards to an ICE vehicle, please feel free to ASK.  I might note that I am still an ardent supporter of the Oil & Gas ⛽️ industry and there are subtleties U learn in the difference b/t EVs & ICE.  Equally, I am also an ardent supporter of EV vehicles, though I will echo Elon musk‘s comments in regard to such:  “If TESLA, today (2023), tried to support the ‘needs’ of all current transportation, it could handle about 1% or so of the nation’s transportation.” - From an interview  sry late last year.  This is, very much, still, a technology in its infancy, that, & like all forms of transportation, since the horse and buggy, will continue to evolve, though I must admit, I don’t mind skipping my gas bill of MANY yrs ago (ESP since last “ICE” vehicle in 2012 was an SUV that ang’d approx 9mpg!).!  Anyway, like all technologies, things will evolve, and people still have  a lot of questions in regards to the EV industry and I’m only happy to answer such questions after a decade of owning/driving exclusively, EV…half of that decade, owning/driving exclusively multiple Teslas.  Also of NOTE: unfortunately, there are people who, dislike the EV industry, primarily out of fear and misinformation. It’s unfortunate as, in all of our lifetimes, ANYbody who is alive today, will ABSOLUTELY NOT be impacted by the EV industry as it pertains to their employment.  Those with this mindset might be wise to think 🤔 of the analogy of the original fear of automobiles when horse and buggies were the primary mode of transportation; “fear of [key word: VERY “EVENTUAL”…NOT “Overnight] CHANGE,” in essence, is what it boils down to.  Again, the EV industry will continue to grow, but for anybody alive today, it certainly will not, nay, CANNOT replace the ICE (Ice Internal Combustion engine) anytime soon; so PLEASE “put away such fears and prejudices; this industry will NEVER impact your livelihood!).  Moreover, such “haters” & naysayers should just relax, and understand that technology, no matter what industry it’s applicable to, will continue to evolve like ALL technology has since the dawn of time.  I could say much more in regards to this but as this is not the place for such discourse, those that do you have legitimate interests, again, feel free to contact me, and I am more than happy to enlighten anybody about the pros and cons of the fantastic “EV World” and help you to understand the differences as they definitely DO exist.

No issues with the chargers themselves. Thanks Telsa for the excellent supercharging network!Charging stations are in a parking lot, right along side the road.  Not much here as far as amenities.  Sonic, a grocery store, and a nail salon.  There are a number of other fast food restaurants nearby, but this is not really a walking neighborhood.

Located in the Wal-Mart parking lot, you will find the charging stalls on the north east area of the parking lot.  Four stalls capable of delivering 350kW. Four CCS and one CHAdeMO plugs. There are no Tesla plugs. You will need to use a CCS to Tesla adapter. Check to make sure your car is also CCS enabled. This has the ability to save some money if you have a subscription to Electrify America's service over the standard price from Tesla's Superstation at certain times. However as mentioned, you will need an adapter and you may have to wait to use this charger during peak times.  Changers can be started via the Electrify America smartphone app or by using a card at the stall. Prices may be cheaper with a monthly subscription on the app.  I was able to get a maxim of 165kW out of the charger with a CCS to Tesla adapter with a cold battery. No Tesla Supercharger in the area.Most of the chargers were out of order.

There was not a car next to me and it was about half full. I would suggest stopping at Centerville or Madisonville 250kw.

The chargers are on the first floor of the parking lot. If you want to use the bathroom you have to go to the airport. It’s a bit of a walk compare to some places. The bathroom are clean and are located on the first floor. When you leave you have to make sure you take your ticket to the person on the booth. So she can let you pass and you don’t pay for parking. But I much rather charge at other charger.Tesla navigation did not lead me to the parking garage where the chargers are located. I drove around for a while until I could physically see the chargers but I couldn’t see a way into the parking garage other than going the wrong way on the one-way street. Which is what I chose to do.  Since it’s an airport, there wasn’t anything to do, although there is a bathroom, and the information desk where you can get your ticket validated.We love Tesla! However this charging station is the hardest to find and is in the middle of nowhere! By far the worst location!!! Tesla also needs to add more than just backup stations they need some drive thru one for cars hauling trailers (pulling a trailer is not recommended as it drains the battery from 306 down to 90 miles)This Tesla Supercharger location was a little difficult to find but is actually a good location.   It is on the lower level of a parking garage so it is covered.  You have to enter the rental car gate, take a ticket and then charge vehicle.  Upon exit, go to line on left with an attendant and they will not charge you any parking fee.  This location has 8 bays and is busy.  The spaces are tighter than usual as this space is at a premium.We are new Tesla drivers that being said...finding the physical stations once you get to the location is like playing  ""Hide and Seek"" or ""Marco Polo"". When I say in completely random places is an understatement. Tesla does a great job at keeping you informed regarding your trip range and how much juice you'll once you get to your location; they need to do better with identifying locators (i.e. 2nd level parking structure, next to Wendy's, in the WAWA parking lot etc)",3.2

Location is excellent as hotel is right off the highway, the guy at the hotel gate didn’t even ask if I had reservation, lol, he said buenos dias and activated up the arm to get in, pretty sure they just know we’re charging! Now the thing that sucks is the ramp up to get to the chargers, it’s super steep so the bumper touched a bit and at the top even going sideways It touched the bottom of the car. Just be careful and go slow and see which side is less steep. Fast chargers!One of the worst charging stations of Tesla. One to two chargers are always broken and 2 of the stations have charging speed of less than 30 miles per hour. Considering the city size Tesla should offer more stations and better speed. The average speed of charging is between 58-90 miles per hour (if you are luckky). We commute from San Diego to Phoenix quite frequently.  The estimate provided by Tesla Maps always turn out incorrect because charging at Yuma always takes more than 1 hour 30 mins compared to suggested charging time of 35 minutes. Please avoid long weekend. We once had to wait for more than 3 hours for our turn to charge and when we finally got our turn, the charging was available at 58 miles per hour which went down to 29 miles per hour. We had to sit there was more than 2.5 hours. There's nothing available closeby. The hotel next to the charging station keeps the door closed for Tesla customers ( may be their policy). We went looking for a restroom and nothing was available nearby. The most pathetic Tesla chargers I have seen so far. Tesla seriously need to upgraded these from 150 to 250kwUPDATE: 10/17 Ok. Location has gotten worse. Charge speed was 54kWh and one charger out of commission. You have to talk to the hotel for the bathroom and restaurant was closed until 5pm at the Hilton. Personally I’d avoid this place going forward on my trips from AZ to CA. Sorry but I’m not taking the 3:10 to Yuma anymore. 😉  Original Post: This location was “ok”. Like many of the other reviews not the best “spot” with amenities, access to bathroom, food, etc… but I was a bit nervous about the charge rate and some people stated it was horrible. So I’m only charging at 1 unit, the last one on the left when facing the chargers unit 4B and it’s not that bad.  It’s giving me a good 110kW for about 450mil/hr. Not the best but not the worst. The location otherwise at 9pm is well lit and doesn’t seem unsafe. Good pit stop between Tucson and San Diego. 2 stars loss for lack of amenities.Same feedback as other people; no food nearby, no bathrooms and location feels like a destination charger next to a hotel. Charging speeds were ok and so far everything was functional. If you can, plan on stopping at the Fortuna Rd one (by Frys) a few miles away.I've had my 2020 model 3 for 3 months now. This super charging location seems to be rated low for several reasons. All I can say is that I'm thankful charging station 3B works. Most superchargers like this work much faster than 86-87 kW. This seemed pretty slow, especially for 9:30pm at night. With my two photos, you can kinda get a view of the area around the charger. I see several buildings under construction. This charging station will probably be better in a few years when this area finishes developing. But as for now, it feels a little sketchy after dark. As several other reviews suggest, I would also recommend skipping this charging location and going straight from Gila Bend to El Centro. Both of those locations provide better options than just sitting in your car... not that sitting in a Tesla is EVER boring! Haha",2.6

The others were twice as slow giving me only 35kW. I ended up at the second stall when you pull in (Black Model Y) and that was the fastest cutting my wait time by 50%.

Overall experience in one word: Pathetic There are a total of 8 charging plugs, 6 of them are low power and 2 of them are 50kw with exclusive tesla plug. When I tried to charge with low powered plug, it didn't work, guess I have to register, so installed the android app, completed the registration and right after that I'm not able to login in the same app, 😑😑 So, I used chrome to login (yes it worked from website but app) and tried to charged, guess what, surprise ! All 6/6 low power plugs are not functional. There is no way to know unless you check the website.  So, I moved to 50kw charge port, it charges you 0.3$/min, too expensive, just for 4% of my model 3 LR, (4kw use) it costed me 1.95$ which is not acceptable as it charges based on time not on kw consumed, (coz, after 80% charging speed will be slow on tesla) so you'd be paying more likely 2x of super charging cost. The speed is not even 1/2x of supercharger but costs you much more.  FYI, I have used volta free charging in lots of places, you just go there and plug it in and that's it.

Diagonal works better for EVs with side-mounted charging ports, and straight-in for EVs with front or back ports. All have very heavy and inflexible cords that tend to stress the EV charging port.

Something to keep in mind.Lots of stores around close to the freeway. Good spotNow that Tesla autos are becoming more popular and there is a very active secondary market for them, the conditions at superchargers need to be addressed before they become a serious problem.  Until the pandemic is over, bathrooms need to be provided or the building nearest to them needs to have bathrooms open at all times.  Carl's Junior used to provide these services, but closed their lobby for the pandemic.  This needs to be addressed for Tesla users.  This is a huge issue and cannot go unaddressed for much longer before it starts to become a public health issue.  The second, connected issue is trash.  Even if you buy food from Carl's Junior, they do not have trash cans you can use.  This causes some people to feel free to throw their trash in the ground in and around the superchargers, giving them a very second rate feeling.  Tesla could easily address these issues by reminding CJ's how much money they make off of Tesla owners and to give some back by re-opening their restrooms for Tesla owners and providing trash services for Tesla owners.  It's not cool at all that CJ's has taken this stance, given how many superchargers are near CJ restaurants.Charging started at 113kw (I was in stall 2A). It's always good to see a high rate.

Plus is 8 Tesla chargers are up and running. The closest thing is a Citgo across the street which the owner isn’t so keen on having a bunch of non customers using their restroom. There is Love’s truck stop on the other side of the overpass (Ie not walkable) that has a restroom, McDonalds, Subway and a convenience store. Would not recommend unless this is a quick charge and you don’t need the restroom or food. Otherwise would either plan to go to Florence to charge if you are on 95. Or plan to make two stops and additional time.It doesn't get more Mom-n-Pop-Shop than this. This oversized convenience store and gas station (Stuckey's) now has 250kW (fast) superchargers! With a Dairy Queen, clean bathrooms, tons of cheap candy and more knickknacks than you can shake a stick at, it's likely that your Tesla will be done snacking before you're done having a look around. If there's a downside, it's how dark and quiet the lot gets late at night. If there's an upside, you get to park your Tesla under the price of gas and enjoy your way cheaper fill-up. :D  The store does close at some point, like other reviewers have said. However, Google says  that's at 7:30 and I was still taking pictures there at 8:50 PM, so there may be seasonal variance.  If you're locked out and need to use a restroom, I suggest driving across the overpass and drop into the Love's Travel Stop.  Past that, this place is a goldmine if you like retro candy, astronaut ice cream diecast cars and cheap souvenirs. It's not often you get the country store feel with your supercharging, so I think this is worth the stop!  (P.S. Also, this is South Carolina, so don't be surprised to see a ton of pro-gun humor and college team signs available for sale/as decor. That may make an uncomfortable environment for some. As someone whose politics generally doesn't align with the signage, I would encourage others to also judge the stop by the people inside.

It's huge with about 21 chargers. If you need to stretch your legs, there's a Publix and shops above and within walking distance. As you enter the parking garage don't dismay, the first two hours are free. You should be charged and ready within that window of time.STATION IS ON P2D Okay so this place was very difficult to find, the charging station is under a parking garage, not under Target its the garage under Atlantic station.  Its on 20th street you make a left then enter and collect a ticket to pay for parking. Don’t worry parking is free for 2 hours and you only need 40 mins to charge.  When you get into the garage and get the ticket make the very first right and drive down.You will see 30 stations and the day i came in, it was kinda full buh yeah definitely took me a while to find especially cus i came from Louisiana.If you're traveling through Atlanta you might want to pass this one. Located in a covered parking garage.   Took a while to get to from I85. Though there's 30 stations there is no signage directing you to them.  You enter through a gate, take a ticket and wander.  Low ceiling and circled around before finding them.  No garage parking fee under 2 hours, thankfully.First time utilizing this SC location and it was great - very chill and easy to get in and out. And I love that if you're just there to charge, you don't have to pay the parking garage rate so long as you're out before 2 hrs (new supercharger in Decatur is not as generous). I was charged up in 35 min and I will never not be happy seeing how little you pay vs. gas.  Tesla navigation is accurate, led me right to P2 level. After you take your ticket, make the first right at the stop and you'll see a small red Tesla sign on a pillar to your left. Keep going straight and you can't miss all the stalls. Happy charging~Fantastic area for a charging station. Enter through the P2 entrance and it's to the immediate right.   I agree there should be signage when u pull in and throughout the garage it would really help. Other than that it's a short walk to tons of shopping, bars and restaurants. Beware the idle fees though, this is a busy station and they don't mess around. Leave your car on the charger and it will cost you. Plus side is parking is free under 2 hours.",4.6

I see several reviews where the say they charged at 250 KW, I was only getting 56 KW both time (AM and PM).As others have stated at the time of this post the Exxon is still under construction. Which is disappointing because I’ll have to find another bathroom. Giving it 5 stars anyway because it’s 250kW and it’s at a (future) gas station.  Not a fan of chargers at venues like the one in Tulsa Oklahoma. Yeah it had a bathroom but it was far away from the chargers in the casino.

As others have said, there are no amenites here, just a convenience mart and gas station under construction.  Bathrooms are across the interstate on the other side of the exit where there is another (Valero) gas station and convience store.  4 stars due to lack of amenities at the moment, but it will be  5 star place once the convenience store opens.Currently (as of Aug 6th) showing ""reduced Service"" on Tesla in car navigation. Due to adjacent construction, 3 of the stalls are blocked. However, the remaining stalls are functioning perfectly.

It is off of a busy street so it gets pretty noisy but there are lots of food options within walking distance including a Mexican restaurant, Chinese restaurant, Popeyes chicken.  Since this is an actual supercharger our charging wattage here was about 120 kW so we were able to get from 20% to 90% within 35 minutes",4.6

(I missed that when I came through at the beginning of the week because there were only a few of us here.) All 6 of the working stalls were in use, but I only had to wait about 5 minutes for someone to leave. After I plugged in 3 more cars arrived and created a line. Even though I was the last vehicle to plug in, I was the first to leave after 18 minutes. I had enough charge to get to OKC with 18% left. No idea how long the others had to wait, but most of the vehicles that were plugged in were unoccupied, so I am guessing the owners were off at one of the restaurants.  Yikes.  There are NOT enough places to stop and charge in Oklahoma! Ardmore is a required stop for almost everyone traveling N to S in Oklahoma, unless you have a long range vehicle and don't mind being below 20% when you stop.

First and last time with EVgoAs another reviewer mentioned, the Level 3 charger is broken and doesn't communicate with your car. The other combo charger wouldn't stay in it's cradle and was just laying on the ground. This was today, April 22, 2022, five months after another reviewer mentioned the same problem. Fortunately, the Level 2 charger worked but I was there for 1 1/2 which was much longer than I had planned. Even then I only got another 35% necessary to get me to another Level 3 on my journey. So an extra hour wasted. Since the other reviewer mentioned that EVgo said they would send someone to fix it, I assumed that in 5 months it got fixed, especially since a lot of people visit the outlet mall. Well I was wrong. First and last time using EVgo.The Level 3's CCS charger was broken when I needed it on 12/19. It refused to make a handshake because the data cable (which is in the top part of the charger) was warped. The first hint was the fact that when I got there the CCS combo charger was on the floor and wouldn't even stay in place in its cradle on the charger.  Anyways, I reported it to the EVGo support and asked for help; but I don't expect it to be fixed any time soon. The newer ChargePoint Level 3's have a better design that seems more durable. Hopefully EVGo has something like this some time soon.  Thankfully, there's a level 2 right there, which saved this from being a 1-star review and me from being stranded. However, I did have to pay $60 for an Uber to get my passengers home since I'd had wait two hours for a charge instead of 10 minutes. Moreover, I don't think it's 24/7 since the mall has stiles which block the parking lot entrance when the mall is closed.Worst service, no power and charged my account with even charging startedNot open 24 hours.

I was not a guest and charged anyways without any obvious issue but I can imagine it becoming one bc the hotel is paying for these charges (I didn’t pay).  I called around trying to find a car dealership or car rental agency in hopes one might have a charging station. There is not one place besides the heat hotel. THIS IS ALL THERE IS.

Also, things to do around so at least the 45 min here isn’t too bad.Absolutely the worst charging experience ever. We were very close to purchasing a non Tesla EV, but Francis has stopped that thought. Never, have we had an issue at a Tesla charger, not ever. We're in Lawton, OK. for 2 days, unable to site see, due to the horrible chargers. They've known for 3 weeks that their fast chargers were down, estimating an additional 2 weeks until they are fixed. We used the slower charger, at 32kw, charged for 2 hours, what should have taken minutes. At 23 cents a minute, and wasting our time, it was a horrible experience. We then added the app, based Francis recommendation, then had to add funds to our account, and the app didn't work with the stations.

Easy charge ( my first one)! And with the Hyundai Ioniq easy peasy. Thanks!... Ugg so yay and no. Lol it's been a crapshoot since October when they overhauled the system, slowed fast chargers, and the app got a lil funky. But over all.. I'm still happy. Update.. the chargers are still slow comparatively to August of las year (2022) word from ABB ( the maintainer) is that new chargers are rolling out and a true 350 KWH  will be among the 150's and that the fastest chargers are to come. Tesla all charge chargers are being done in NM by 2024.It's in the parking lot of Walmart. There are quite some charging stations available at the site. Notice that there are two types of stations: one is up to 150kW another is up to 350 kW which they call ""hyper"". If your car supports charging at higher kW, make sure to park and charge at the efficient one. If you don't want to wait in the car for 15 minutes or so, stop by Walmart or other nearby places to grab a sandwich for example.Nationwide, Electrify America is just pitiful, individual chargers often don't work, and sometimes all the chargers are offline, this location is no different. Relying on the Electrify America network for road trips is a very risky proposition. If you're doing road trips, my recommendation is to buy a Tesla and use their bulletproof Supercharger network.Ugh. When will the stations be updated? Many connectors are falling apart and often don't work. I have had to call EA for assistance every time I've charged recently. I do appreciate that there are 10 stations.",2.6

Almost exclusively over the past 3 weeks traveling from charger to charger I’ve been disappointed to wait in a hotel parking lot or other plaza, nowhere near real food (I’m looking at you too Applebees). The drought ended today with the pleasant soup/sandwich and ice cream offerings at the delightful U Drop Inn cafe! Others have pointed out that there is an 24 hour outdoor restroom open if you happen to come when the cafe is closed. How nice! This type of experience is what I expected charging would be like but not so at other places. This place is the pleasant exception and not the rule. Usually one finds herself in a dirty parking lot without so much as a trash can. Thanks for doing it right, Shamrock!  I should probably mention that the charging seemed to be perfectly fine, but honestly it’s not the headline. Get some real food, rest a spell, and appreciate how clean everything is.Super fun place!  We got there after hours but still got some fun photos. NOTE: There IS a restroom you can use even when the shop is not open.  It’s next to the garage with the antique truck.  Its a single person bathroom, that is not inside the building.  The door opens straight onto the sidewalk.  I assumed it was closed…but a friendly fellow charging Tesla driver told me they were open.  The photo helps show where the bathroom is 😂Six chargers behind the iconic Conoco Tower building, which was built in the 1930s as a gas station/cafe along Route 66. It now houses the U-Drop-In Cafe and a gift shop. There's also a McDonalds about 100 yards down on the opposite side of the street.Stopped by for a quick charge and made some lunch while I was at it. Plenty of room and it was nice to have a restaurant next door if that's your speed.

This station is a five-minute drive from I-40 but easy to find.Tried out our Tesla’s CCS converter for the first time here. The drawback of using a non Tesla supercharger is that the battery doesn’t precondition ahead of time on your trip, so recharge rates are slower. Though we plugged into to 350 kW “hyper charger,” we only managed speeds of 70-71kW… we were on our way south of the Grand Canyon on 40 and should have just topped off at Tusayan. Also, EA rates are pricier than Tesla’s. However, in a pinch these work … if you have the right converter! Also, the La Quinta Inn has a nice, warm lobby and clean bathrooms.Very nice charger and hotel. Goes without saying a Tesla must have a CCS adapter.

It's also got the best view of any Supercharger I stopped at off I-40, which makes it a fabulous day-time stop.  At night, Stuckey's is all there is so it gets lonely fast. The store closes after 9 PM, so you lose access to the toilets and the Dairy Queen inside (if it's late and you can make it to Hickory or Asheville, I suggest you go there).  Speaking of toilets, that's my only real CON about this place. The toilets were terrible the last time I stopped here. Even if they were to be freshly serviced, the bathroom itself feels like it'll never be that be clean (or dry). On the other hand, it looks like there are showers available if you ask. I've definitely stopped at more welcoming Stuckey's though.  PROs? Cheap candy, and Stealth Bombers to keep you occupied (if you're not driving).The supercharger is great. High Kwh capacity, and right before the big hill climb to black mountain. That said, the area has nothing aside from an old gas station and run down DQ.

There is a dog walking area in the front and the building on the far end has a nice cafe. I always make sure to stop in on my travels.We stopped at the supercharger site this morning. It was a very good experience. The superchargers were in a great location. Within walking distance, the Bramble Berry Cafe was open and the baked goods were just coming out of the oven. We had coffee and muffins and wandered a bit in the very interesting and full antique shop. Nearby is a Jamaican Bread shop (closed this morning) and a winery shop and another shop full of yard art and other crafts. If you are craving fast food, there is a Wendy’s across the road near the Pilot gas station. Highly recommend the bakery!Wish there was some more options for restrooms & snacks. The store is not always open but they were very nice when it was open! Great place to walk my puppy around and stretch out my legs. There was a station across the street and a lot of food options on this exit for snacks or meals. Fast charger as well!",4.8

I would not recommend this location if you're in a rush or driving along the I-15. This isn't the place where you want to stop, even though it has 250kw chargers.  I think this location is meant for shoppers of the outlet. There is a ticketing booth that will charge for parking (for non-Nevada residents, as of 2023). Tesla supercharger users can enter/leave without paying, but you'll have to request for the gate to be opened.  It's not scenic, it's not necessarily convenient unless you're a shopper, and there's that annoying bit about possibly paying for parking or waiting for an attendant to open the gate.  The chargers themselves work and the location seems great for locals/shoppers. There are plenty of food choices, restrooms, and things to do while you wait.  I just need to emphasize that this location is not recommended for travelers; rather, it is perfect for shopping that takes between 30mins - 1 hr.The people paying for, don't read the signs that state tesla owners don't pay... there are instructions to call via the intercom, and they open the exit, without payment. It's actually very fast, I've never been stuck waiting for the attendant to respond.It says 250kw max, but in reality you get around 50kw. Which pretty much forces you to go shopping at the outlets since it will take over an hour to charge it to full before heading back home.This is the worst charging station I have been to.

In my opinion, if you’re going to be at a supercharger and not stay in your car it defeats the purpose of it as other need to use it. The whole point of a supercharger is be a quick charge and then be done so the next person may use it. Leaving your car camping at one just takes away from the people who actually need it in a pinch. If you’re going to leave for a long period of time and explore Tivoli Village do everyone a favor and take the slower supercharger so those who actually just need a quick charge may use it.The bulk of fast charges are still unavailable. I had to wait for one of the two fast chargers at the front of Tivoli, right off Rampart. It was one of those days I didn’t plug my car in at night, so I needed to rely on a quick charger.

This station does charge for power, scanning the QR code at the power source prompts you to add the app and add a credit card for payment.  This station is not fast-- it took about 4 hours to fully charge our battery from 50%, but much faster than plugging into a 110 wall outlet.  It is in a great location, and we happily spent those hours shopping, eating and wandering around the plaza.Avoid at all costs. I brought my Tesla here due to some high winds about a week ago. It took me and my husband 50 minutes to even get the charging started. When we did get it started, it charged at 7mi/hr, which is about the same as a standard wall outlet.  The mobile app, neither iOS nor Android, worked at all. It just errored out with no option. We spent the majority of the time trying and trying again the browser app to get to payment without timing out. The site itself seems to have been created in Italy where the creators assume you are located. The app didn’t work at all unless the charger was plugged in, however the instructions state differently.  If you absolutely need to use this one, here is what you should do. 1. Start with the charger plugged into your car. Scan the CR code on the charger. 2. Follow the prompts but make sure you adjust your address from Italy to US. Also make sure you use your billing address for the credit card you plan to use. The site will take about 30 seconds to load each step. 3. There are several screens where you will need to enter your information. 4. You will need to attempt this process several times because if you get a timeout message throughout any of the steps, you will have to start over from scratch. Trying to get back to where you were will be fruitless. 5. Finally, at the end, you will get a message warning you that the car is not plugged in and you have 60 seconds to do so. The car should already be plugged in and beginning to charge. Do not remove the charger from the car or you will have to start at the beginning.  Good luck!This was a life saver, TAOS city has no TESLA chargers or any EV chargers for that matter. The one shown in TESLA app are either closed or unavailable for general public.

A dog station would be helpful so nobody is walking in circles around the poo.Four out of eight are out of order. Tesla map shows which ones (1A, 1C, 2B, 2C) are not working. But there are no labels on the supercharger so you will have to try to plug in to find out which one is working or not working. Avoid this one if you can.",3.6

It's a match made in heaven in an excellent location off of I-95!  Definitely the stop for night time travel too!  The great thing about the fast v3 stalls is that by the time you use the (usually) clean toilets, place an order for hot food and then receive it, your Tesla is done with its snack and is good for the next leg of your trip. This Sheetz, like most others, has fantastic staff, a clean layout, and toilets you can access 24/7 (unlike strip mall based charging stops). It's also large enough to have an eating area so if you want to chill for a little longer and enjoy your greasy messy Big Mozz sandwich or something you can do so without getting your car all dirty. :)  Traffic can be a little heavy at times, since this is a very good location for any kind of fueling up, but bonus points for putting the charging stalls near the drive-thru lane. Most of the non-tesla traffic on this side of the building is in the separate drive way to place the order which makes pulling into a spot a little easier. This partnership with Sheetz just gets better and smarter all the time!  Not quite the best spot to charge before bailing onto 295 and avoiding the Richmond mess, but it's not far.

Please note it is in the back of the building off the main road. You need to go deep in the back. 41 cent per kw.OK. The cons are the same that everyone else points out. Actual location is hard to find off of HWY 41 in Oakhurst. Charging speeds vary. Here's why I give it 5 stars 🌟: it's in Oakhurst on highway 41 between Fresno and Yosemite and close to Bass lake. There still is the Fish Camp superchargers closer to Yosemite but the Tesla supercharger network keeps expanding to rural areas and are popping up in more areas than any other EV charging network including places like Oakhurst. 5 stars just for putting a supercharger in a location I never thought I would see one in 😁👍. Now where are all the other EV DC fast chargers for non-Teslas? Gotta catch up other companies 😉The Superchargers at Tenaya Lodge we're not functioning for the whole week so this Supercharger in Oakhurst might be a place for you to top off before heading into Yosemite Valley.You will want to turn right at the Oakhurst Inn white on red sign (before the lumber company) and drive around the right to the back. There are 2 back-in stalls on the left and 6 (?) drive forward stalls on the right. It is pretty tight. I wish there were Wi-Fi. If you walk out to Hwy 41 there are several restaurants close by. Very convenient charging if driving in to Yosemite and staying close by, for example at Bass Lake. It can be a little scary back there at night.Located in the parking lot behind the Oakhurst Inn on the right hand side. This charger is conveniently located in town, though as many reviewers have noted the charging speed is not sustained as soon as more Teslas are charging. Despite that, it's a clean, safe location.",4.4

Turnover is quick so there is a good chance of getting a spot. These spots are within an illuminated area at night.Avoid this location. It's a busy place with Walmart and other stores, so the chargers are almost always occupied. It's exacerbated by the fact that the chargers are located close to the Walmart entrance, so there are people who simply park their cars in charging stalls. Neither police nor guards get involved, so they do it with impunity. Almost every time I've been there, the ICE vehicle and/or Teslas, which were not charging (perhaps lacking adapter) were blocking the stalls. Additionally, the charging power is pretty poor.

I use the electrify America app to see what stations are available and work. Upon arriving most of the charging stations I’ve been to (scipio, st George, beaver) haven’t been great. Only giving this 2 stars because it charged the first time. I’ve called customer service at least a 6 times within 9 days. There’s 4 stations at this location and only one works here which is really inconvenient for other cars. I hope they can maintain the charging stations better. Nearly all stations claim they’re fast chargers but most don’t go past 60-90 kw which leaves you stuck here charging for about 30-40 minWorked great for super charge.  Picked up our account on the car and initiated charge with no problem.  (Green charger)From my experience of using chargers, you may need to try a few times before you can charge... that said, Electrify America always has a working charger and I can charge and go without any problems. I charged my Chevy Bolt in Scipio and Ceder City during a trip from northern Utah to St George. It worked great and I had only minor problems of having to try a few times. I'd give 4.5 stars because of that, but otherwise it's so cool to have a working infrastructure for EVs.  At the time of this review, the total cost was just shy of $30 for two 50 minute stops. And I really didn't need to stop for 50 minutes in Ceder City, just chose to top up to 80% since I was there. The Electrify America chargers are much more capable than the 50 minutes I needed to charge, because of the car's limitations. The Bolt is a slow charging vehicle compared to other EVs in the same price range. I used 150 kw chargers and my car can only do 50 kw. To sum up, I'm very happy with how successful and reliable Electrify America chargers are!

The Tesla navigator strangely takes you clear past the are to the last and third entrance. So if you have been there before you know that.

I suggest multiple improvements to the Tesla website so you can locate chargers with restaurants, hotels and popular  sites.

I was worried it wasn't in service with the UI in our vehicle stating it was operating at reduced service.  So far I've used two different chargers and they both worked as expected.  This station is so new that it doesn't even have labels yet as of September 5th, 2020.  6 stalls. I'm assuming it's going to be A and B stalls adjacent to each other (like the newer stations have).  Update (7/Sept/2020): 2nd charger from right keeps malfunctioning when trying to latch. All others are in working order as of this update.Supercharger near Ocean City Maryland on Rt. US 50 just before the bridge into Ocean City. It's conveniently located at a Royal Farms. As you can see from the pictures, at first the electrons were flowing very fast. When I had only sixty miles of charge, the battery was accepting nearly 500 miles of range per hour of charge. If only it had stayed like that, but no. It didn't.  As the amount of charge increased, the rate of charge decreased. I'm told that this is what happens at all supercharging stations. By the time I got to 80%, my rate of charge dropped to 146 miles of range per hour of charge. By the time I was closing in on 90%, my rate of charge was around 100 miles of range per hour of charge. Clearly, the best strategy for long trips is to keep the battery below 80% because recharging above that takes a long time. This works only if charging stations are very close to the route and reasonably close to each other.  Another trip to O.C. Different charge stall than before. Still works the same way. My strategy, when spending a weekend in Ocean City, is to top up the Tesla right before driving into O.C. That gives me enough electricity to get through the weekend without recharging. Then I recharge on the way home.2019 Model 3 charging at 250+ kW (1021 m/hr) and it’s also in easy walking range to many restaurants.  It’s in the parking lot of a Royal Farms also so there’s those snacks and restrooms if you just want something quick.There are six chargers here. At least two of them are defective. I spent an hour trying to charge at one, and managed to add about 100 miles of charge before it generated some kind of network error and turned itself off.  Another Tesla owner had a similar experience at the stall next to me. But he was smarter and tried several different stalls before discovering that 1A, the westernmost charger, provided a normal charging experience.  The chargers are at a Royal Farms convenience store, and if what you want can be purchased there, it's fine. Lots of nearby restaurants, but they are across a fast, dual lane highway and require a dangerous run across the road.Conveniently at Royal Farms. Also many nearby places on Route 50 to pick up a snack on the way to enjoy while charging.  Well lit with nearby police patrols.

My primary complaint is that it usually seems to want to peak way below expected charge rates even with a conditioned battery pack below 50%.  I've tried moving slots a few times when this happens.  Only once did it ever seem to improve the charge rate.  I don't think the problem is my car since I've seen other V3s work as expected.",4.6

To reach the chargers, take the first left-turn into the parking lot from Iron Point Road and then turn right again to enter the parking lot. The four parking spaces are along edge of the lot near Iron Point Road, but roughly in the middle of the lot between the the first and second parking lot entrances.  The location could be better. There is no overhead cover against rain and sun, and nothing above eye-level to indicate where in the parking lot the chargers are located. There's no sidewalk nearby and the short charging cables mean you have to park nose-in and cannot pull through when leaving. The rightmost two parking spots are the most convenient - they back onto an aisle between rows of cars, while the two spots on the left are across from a curb and row of cars, which gives you less space to back out.  The Folsom Premium Outlets are convenient if you are traveling Highway 50, less so if you need to get back onto I-80.

I've sometimes had issues with one of the chargers being unresponsive or not working. But it's a convenient location. Until it's after 9pm. Electrify America says this is a 24 hr location but access is cut off once the outlet mall is closed.Google maps, as of 12/16/2022 has the charging stations incorrectly located at the mall.  it's basically under the I-270 south bound ramp.  there is a central reservation opening that has been blocked off, and the mapping makes it look like you have to go into the parking lot.  do not do this, the parking lot is a zoo.  just go all the way around the mall drive and come up on the chargers the long way around.  also, not sure why all the new developments in MD up to Frederick are being designed with roundabouts basically no one knows how to use them, people are either impatient or very confused, no one knows how to sign and the mall itself, a zoo in the parking lot.  long story short if you're not a native of the area, best to avoid the station unless you really need it.  I've submitted a change request from Google maps, not sure if it will get fixed - just take the long way around.  oh and the first charger I went to had a cord with a communication error.Beware that Google maps has the location slightly wrong. You need to enter the Premium Outlets and the chargers are located on the outer parking lot close to the Michael Kors store. If you follow Google maps you'll find yourself entering I-270 with no way back!Electrify America was great when I first got my EV in February. Since then there seems to have been a steady decline. Half the stations are broken and it can take over 30 min to get support on the line only to find out that the station you are trying to use, and looks like it is in service doesn't actually work - but they won't take it off line to prevent people from wasting their time.

However the way these four stations are organized is really confusing and definitely not optimized for each one being used or for the multiple different plug in locations on today's ev vehicles. And then there is the price. I know the infrastructure is expensive. Yet I also have heard Colorado provides grants for the instilation... So why then do they charge $0.43/ kWh. Sure you can be a member for a cheaper rate but it's not a savings worth writing home about. Though at least you can pay on the spot without being a member.  So to sum it up. I'm happy to have and see DC charging stations. But feel the project was a poorly planed. Yet on the plus side there's no parking fee, only the kwh fee.I like charging here when we're staying at our condo in Keystone, the SIGNET dispensers at this location are very reliable.

My only complaint is that when this area is busy and the lot is full of ICE cars and EVs, EV drivers who must back into these angled stalls will have some difficulty (i.e. backing in without touching the Rivian in the stall to the right; or the Lucid Air in the stall to the left; or without ramming into bubba's truck nuts equipped tow hitch on the F-250 parked in the stall directly on the other side of the one way lane).

Trundling along at 75-88kw. I’m the only one here early in the morning.  I have not scrolled through the other reviews so sorry if this has already been mentioned.  The lines are painted wrong. If you park per them the SC is directly behind you instead of the left corner. Again I’m the only one here so I split the difference to line up correctly.  Photo attached.  Therefore the poor rating.  I’ve never been here when it’s busy.  I wonder if the misaligned spots cause a problem. I run a bike carrier so it’s crucial that the spots are lined correctly so that I can back up very close to the SC to reach the port.  Otherwise nicely located fairly close to freeway and far enough from the entrances to discourage ICEing.Whoever either painted/spaced the lines, or whoever installed the chargers did so in a pretty bad manner. Lots of parking spots don’t align correctly with any of the stalls. So you’re forced to look dumb and park on lines or bend cables to get them to the car for charging.  Besides that the charging rates here keep going up by a lot. With the amount of surface area the mills mall has you’d think there would be enough solar harvesting around to offset some costs but that only seems to be a EU thing apparently.

Columbus received a total of $50 million in the form of two grants, $40 million from USDOT and $10 million from Vulcan, Inc., a Paul Allen company. These dollars provide the seed funding for Smart Columbus, a region-wide Smart City initiative co-led by the City of Columbus and Columbus Partnership.  The City of Columbus, under the leadership of Mayor Andrew J. Ginther, is the lead recipient of the $50 million and will administer the deployment of these funds for the duration of the grant period, which concludes at the end of 2020.  The Columbus Partnership, representing the Columbus Region’s private sector, is the lead implementation partner for the grant program and is responsible for the initiative’s Acceleration Fund, which is credited as a significant factor in Columbus’ winning of the challenge. The Acceleration Fund, which started out as $90 million now totals more than $360 million and is composed of coordinated and aligned investments by the private and public sector to compliment, scale, and sustain Smart Columbus projects and programs.",5.0

I was there midday on a weekday and the traffic in and out of the gas station was steady, not terribly busy.  Hotels and other amenities in walking distance but it wouldn’t be a pleasant walk.Convenient location in the Sheetz lot with 8x superchargers. The restrooms are clean and there’s a good selection in the convenience store. Breezewood has a lot of fast food, but the intersections are large and you may want to drive there after charging (as opposed to walking).This charger in Sheetz parking is only 150kW, but being next to Sheetz is great ... restrooms, food ... ALWAYS OPEN 👍.  Down the road is a 250kW charger but that plaza closes early so no restroom nor food when that happens, beware!One of my least favorite charging stops. There's nothing wrong with the terminals, just the process of getting in and out is so painful. This is the intersection of multiple highways. Expect to spend about 15 minutes on top of your plan to stop sitting in traffic. Expect there to be a line for the bathroom. Expect for the parking lot to be so crowded that multiple charging slots are used by non-Tesla vehicles.  Protip- the lights to exit the sheetz have approximately a four-minute cycle. There's always a massive line to exit the gas station. Wait until the lights turn green and the entire queue clears out onto the street. Quickly get out of your car disconnect the charger and then pull forward and you'll be at the front of the queue. Exit the gas station in 4 minutes when the light next turns green. If you want to be really fancy proactively unplug your car, wait until the exit queue clears and then quickly pull onto the tail of the line to exit the gas station without waiting at all.Good spot to charge. Sheetz has public bathrooms and plenty of food along with WiFi and an eating area to hang out. There are some outdoor seating areas too. The subtraction of one star is simply due to the difficulty of getting out of Sheetz since the intersection has long lights.",4.2

I think it is a great idea to put superchargers next to gas stations with good amenities. The gas station store is nice, good bakery and coffee.Do not rely on this Charger. I went there 8/28/22 and NONE of the stalls worked. You’d think this would show up on the Tesla Nav or something but nope. BARELY had enough charge to go 40+ miles away to the nearest supercharger.I think Tesla supercharger are a waste of time. If you want a real car or truck electric is not a good choice.",3.2

It’s never once been at capacity.16 charge spots and rarely full.  The Brunswick square mall is okay as far as malls go but you do have an easy walk to the Barnes and noble that also has a cafe.  The mall has a Red Robin burger place, Bar Louie with outdoor dining, Panera Bread and a few smaller places inside the mall.  There is also an AMC theater here as well.   There are 4 Volta chargers here with no specific time limits but since those are in prime parking spots those are usually filled with non EVs.

There is also an Evgo charging station with 6 open spots. I don't know anything about EVGO but will explore it.8 charging stations for Tesla cars.  Like most Tesla stations in a mall, they are a little bit of a walking distance from the mall itself but then close chargers in some malls like Volta chargers (usually in the front spaces of the mall) are taken up by non EV vehicles or taken up by EV vehicles that don’t leave the spot for hours.  They are several eateries that can be walked to like Menlo Park pizza and McDonald’s.  You can eat inside Menlo Park when open.  You can walk a little further to the Menlo Park Diner.  If you dare cross the big 3 lane/2 lane (5 lanes in either direction) street you can get to a Panera’s, sonic, and White Castle as well as a Margarita’s Mexican Restaurant.  Seasons 24 is also close by as well.  There is a 7-11 nearly as well.  Late at night you eating options are the Menlo Park diner or you can pick up White Castle or McDonald’s before you park to charge.  I’m not sure if the sonic will return to 24 hour service again post COVID.  If people complain that the charging stations are too far from the mall.  No one is enforcing if a gas car parks in an EV charge spot…. That’s why the charging spot for Tesla and EVGo are isolated from the mall.  No one else is going to want to park there.  If you need an example, go to nearby Woodbridge mall and see if you can ever get into the Volta charging stations in front of the Macy’s.  Or even if an EV car is parked in those spaces.  Every time I’ve gone they have never been available… why?  The two chargers are right in front of the entrance to Macy’s there and prime parking spots.  A similar problem can happen on WaWa on Route 9 where large trucks and other vehicles will block or take up the charge spots because they simply don’t careWas there on Saturday morning, around 7am.

The only time these chargers work efficiently is after a call to electrify or you are willing to drive to Greene Acre Mall super fast chargers. Evolve & Electrify get it together!!!There are about 10 Electrify America charging stations here. Each station has a CCS and CHAdeMO connector. You plug in the connector first, and then follow the onscreen instructions to pay with a credit card. At the time of writing this on a Sunday at 5pm it was $0.35/kWh. Not sure if it varies by time or not. That's cheaper than the Tesla Supercharger nearby so if you are waiting already anyways at this cell phone lot, it might be better to charge here (if you have the CCS adapter that is).  The credit card reader has a tap-and-pay option but it always failed for me on different credit cards without giving a reason. Only when you slide in the credit card with the chip did the payment go through. I also had trouble with some stations (""charging error"") so I had to repark the car to try a different one.  After payment is authorized, charging starts and you have the option to leave a phone number for charging updates or download the app. I was able to get a throughput of 44kW but to be fair I also had a high state of charge. Once charging is complete or you stop charging, the card is then charged.  Parking is free as it's inside the cell phone parking lot. There are restrooms nearby and sometimes a food truck is here too.Easy to use. You have option to pay with credit card not like other stations that require a specific card or app this one is pretty straightforward you just plug in charge and pay just like at a regular gas station.

It is about a 10 to 15 minute drive from the BQE highway exit depending on traffic so you have to go a bit out of your way to get to the location. As of this review, all 25 chargers work with ccs1, 23 work with tesla, and 2 work with chademo.  You could pay with credit card, or tap with the revel app if you put in payment info within the app. Just be aware that that I was told by a Revel tesla taxi driver that sometimes the payment might not work at a station from time to time. This happened to me on my first visit. I could not get my payment to work. The driver suggested I try a different stall and that solved the problem. So if you have trouble paying to get the chargers started, try try again.  As of this review, the price of the charge is priced at 39 cents a kwh plus tax. Some of the chargers says 75 kwh max but my tesla only got just below 50 max and at times dip to the high 30s. I read that is common. Not sure if that is limited to tesla or most evs here.  I am really glad this place exists. Nyc really need more places like this to make evs work. Hope this survives and that they would expand to other locations in NYC.  I had to take out a star though because it would be nice to have a restroom for those long charge times if needed.I have been to this charger four times over the past two weeks. The chargers are supposed to push 75kw. They have never reported charging above 44kw. My Tesla Model Y has never reported charging above 36kw despite the meter saying it was charging at 44kw. There are lots of spaces but there are zero amenities (no bathroom, no food, sketchy bodega two blocks away). I am really excited for this location to improve (we need this!!!) but as of July 20 it’s barely operating. Don’t give up Revel, we need you!I read all of the bad reviews at this station and wanted to give it a try myself with the new Tesla brand CCS adapter because I read that Tesla’s could only get 50KW with the Tesla adapter that the charging station has.  I’m pleased to find out that with the CCS adapter I got 71KW at its peak and 56KW at its low point. It was a really cold day so it took my battery sometime to heat up but I would assume on a nicer day I could hit 70KW faster.  Just be aware that this station puts a pre charge of $30 on your credit statement and it adjusts to what you will actually be charged.Note, per the specs limit of the ""Tesla CHAdeMO Adapter"" that Revel uses to charge Teslas as this site, 50 kW is the fastest possible speed you'll see, but other brands should see faster speeds using the CCS connector.  This is an inclusive facility with the promise for much easier ownership of any EV brand that’s capable of DC fast charging, which is nearly every EV sold today. It should really help make EV ownership much more of a possibility for local residents of Brooklyn, without having to pay to get into a garage just to charge.  There were some payment processing issues experienced by several Teslas on the evening of July 7 2021, the very first day Revel launched their payment processing system at this site. Contactless payment (Apple Pay with non-Amex card such as Visa or Apple Card) seemed to work better than magnetic card swipes or chip reading. I have compiled a list of the variety of issues we saw, and reported them to Revel on July 8th 2021. Revel has stated that at least some of the known issues have been resolved.Brand new 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-e (extended battery) was showing 71.4kW+ when charging there for the first time, I wouldn't be surprised if it reached 75KW after it conditioned when I wasn't looking. It sure beat SLO Chargers, I mean FLO Chargers.",3.8

Please note that for each charger, only one connector can be used at any given time.  You are charged based on the time connected, not on the amount of energy delivered, so you will not be getting your money's worth if your vehicle already has a high state of charge.  In general, it is more cost effective and better etiquette to fast charge only until around 80% state of charge.

I was expecting something like 70+ and was charged $11.49. Called EVGO support and they say, ""Once the charge reached 80% it slows down or stops"". It stops charging but continues billing.

It's a shared rest area and walled off for north vs south bound traffic. Tesla instructed us to U-turn off an exit to enter, and had to double back in the wrong direction to turn around again and added 49 mins to our journey.

Yes, I parked in your precious parking space, tesla; but you went completely Putinesque with your response.  To be more precise: those parking spaces are not parking spaces: they are charging spaces. Even a tesla owner may not park there for FIVE MINUTES after the conclusion of charging, or tesla will start billing their account a trespassing fee.

Also a decent patch of grass and shade if you just want to stretch and sit in the grass!Made some friends while charging, walked right up to the car and lightly honked a few times (probably waiting for food).  They eventually got bored and goose-walked away.  Charger worked great though, our first supercharging experience with our new 3.

I later discovered that I was going to be charged idle time fee, which makes no sense since it should not have been idle, It should have continued charging.Generally not too busy. Lots to do within short walking distance.Nice place to charge, while waiting you can grab food or visit bestbuy or across the street to the mall.  The cons? Sometimes even you are the only one in there the charging is very slow, it will take time to complete your charge even you have preheat your battery.When I go charge nice place also to grab something to eat when chargingThe cables are great and deluxe electric is provided to your car.

The exit also has a cracker barel and various fast food and convince stops. The hotel is large enough to be staffed 24hrs in case you or the kids need a place place where you can use the facilities if you're just passing through.  CAME BACK  through a week later had to down grade my review from 5 stars. Here's why, Snow removal is Key in the frozen north when you have a 4' cord on a supercharger so either make sure your people clear the snow enough to plug in the $100,000 car so I can continue on my Jorney with wading Knee deep in snow or at least put a 12' cord on the charger so I don't have to beach said vehicle on a snow bank just to hook it up to the gogo juice! To add insult to injury This seems to be an ongoing problem the #4 charger plug is damaged enough not to work. Probbly from somone not willing to back up enough to plug it in properly in sub zero temperatures  this is Eire Pensyltucky not like it dosn't snow more months a year than it's sunny, for the Californians that designed the supercharger stations. Begs the question Elon Musk, you've upgraded the cars, many times so if you're interested in what costomers think how about bringing supercharger stations forward with those cars. Oh and feel free to give me call for some much needed non billionaire  perspective.",2.4

Yes, this only has THREE stations, worse than even the typical four, so you will almost always be waiting in line if you visit during a rush hour.4/19/23 station 1's CCS is unavailable, so far the app has been reliable in showing which are down.  12/24/2022 one station was out of order for a couple of days last week, it looks like repairs are handled quickly again. I recommend using the charger as early as you can in the winter months to avoid a long wait in the bitter cold! More people need to charge more often so it gets busy in the evenings.  11/21/22 all 3 stations have been operable for the last three months.

Station 2 is the only one working and it doesn't seem to be working for everyone. It's a real shame because I've only seen all 3 operational a few times in May and June, rarely in July and the problems are persisting into August. I work nearby and charge here every time I dip below 25%. Lately my last few charges have been at 44/45 kw. I drive a '19 BMW i3, so it maxes out at 50 kw.  I do like that there's a Barnes N Nobles nearby with a cafe to kill time.

We have previously charged nearby at Benton, that station was a bit faster.EDIT (4/16/21):  Well, it’s been 2 weeks and I don’t see a noticeable difference in these chargers. Although, the two that use to not work at all appear to be operating at least. There were 6 vehicles here for one charge and I was getting 35kwh plugging in at 30%. I plugged in with two other vehicles at 20% and was getting 90kwh, and have gotten over 100kwh once when I was down to 10%. Overall, I expected to get over 100 anytime I was near 20% but that doesn’t appear to be the case, and by the time I’m up to 40-50% I’m down to around 40kwh. It’s only been between 40-50 degrees, so I know that can slow it, but with 15mins to precondition and a couple days in the 60’s I just don’t think it’s going to be much better. Maybe my expectations were just unrealistic from a couple other V3 chargers I’ve been to.  I can say up to 80% it is staying above 30kwh, which is better than I noticed previously.

None of the chargers stalls were working. Tried all of them but nothing. After multiple chats and calls and hours with Tesla and they suggested third party chargers so went to the closest one available. (In the meantime Tesla has marked the supercharge as “under planned maintenance” for a week.) The ChargePoint charger we went to was a 7 kW charger. After another hour with Tesla to arrange a tow to a faster charger they mentioned that this has to be paid out of pocket and not covered by Tesla. When explained the fact that this was a problem with the supercharger and not the car they mentioned that it might happen that the supercharger would not work at times. Which basically means that the superchargers are unreliable as well and if you’re stuck like us get ready to spend out of your own pocket for a tow. Also after the tow even if you reach the next supercharger there is no guarantee that the super chargers will work. It might be in the same situation as this one ( while on the chat with Tesla they could see that 2 of the stalls were not working but all others were working which was clearly not the case when we reached. There was another model 3 which faced the same issue). Sorry for the long review but be careful specially if you’re traveling with family and small kids in winter.Horrible.

I've been driving past them for months --most of a year-- and have never seen any cars using them. None of the pictures in these reviews show any cars, either.  Saw an interesting article recently about Tesla chargers. California passed a law requiring that chargers display the cost of charging, along with other info you might expect on a gas pump. Tesla chargers have no such displays...yet. Not in CA, not here, either.  My limited experience with commercial chargers is that they tend to have pricing equivalent to the price of gasoline...even though the electric cost is far less. How do they get away with it? Well, they're aimed (especially these Tesla chargers) at transient vehicles, those who can't simply go home and plug it in (at a fraction of the cost). Captives. No wonder there is no display to tell you how much your ""fuel"" is costing!  Pretty, though. And plenty of space for your car!  2023 update: three years later, there are now cars using the chargers.Excellent location - 5 minute walk to many restaurants and shops. This fills a much needed supercharging gap that existed in the Finger Lakes region.Great location, high power (150 kw, so our model S was drawing 120 kw, but that will vary based upon your state of charge)... not too busy, 5/5 would charge again.  Update, May 2021: Now that Trader Joe's has opened right by the supercharger, it is even better.Fabulous supercharge service- just to comment on cost- it’s CHEAP! $6-$8 typically and the fee shows up instantly on my cell phone/credit card charge. Ted also commented that he never sees any cars there- (a waste?) but that’s probably because it takes only 10-15 minutes to charge up! A quickie: in and out. My greatest reservation about all-electric vehicles was “range anxiety” which Tesla has solved for!

We stopped here mid morning to find an oversized RV towing a small pickup truck blocking all but two of the stalls.  The restaurant manager left an overly polite note on the RV letting them know that they ""next time"" they should park over on the side of the building, and that these spots were reserved.  The manager said that no one in the restaurant acknowledged that it was their RV.  She said she called the police ""non-emergency line"" to report it.  When I called the police, and asked to have it towed, they said they couldn't tow it without the business owner's permission.  The police told me that they had no record of the restaurant manager having called.  I'm thinking that if that RV had blocked the front door of the restaurant, that manager might have been more proactive.  Tesla needs to figure out a way to prevent this from happening because we drivers seem to be powerless to do much about this kind of situation.There’s a diner nearby and some fast food places a short walk away but no super accessible bathrooms.

Charging station 4 is still one of the older models but it still works fine as it is the one I used.  UPDATE 3: visited on 12/19/22. All 3 of the newly installed charging stations were “unavailable”. The older station still there was operational and in use.  It appears this location has become unreliable since they chose to upgrade the charging stations. Very disappointing.Recently upgraded to latest generation chargers. Hopefully reliability will improve as a result and our first charge here post-renovation was flawless.I live in the city of Buffalo and these chargers are down/unavailable more than they are available. Oftentimes, there's only one charger available for use making it especially difficult for people who visit this area and have no other alternatives. These chargers malfunction during colder months, y'all gotta work that out because the temps in Buffalo can get frigid. The availability of chargers should also be transparent via internet search engines (Google, Bing, etc.) and not only using your app. I've spoken to many nice out-of-town folks (some who don't speak fluent English -add more language selections on the stations) who go into panic mode when they can't charge their vehicle because chargers are limited. I always offer up mine because I am closer to home and never want to experience what that feels like. The demand for EV's doesn't align with the supply of charging stations and/or the amount of kWh sometimes promised per charge. There's too much stress and pressure on consumers and not enough action taken by Companies who should be making the transition from gas to an EV easier. The goal for creating a cleaner Earth is a bit one-sided. You have to supply better chargers if you really want to ""Electrify America"".Works good once you get it to connect. While the chargers initially wouldn’t accept the EA Apple wallet member card, they did work the last time I was there, otherwise have to initiate from the mobile app.  3 of 4 chargers seem to be working now, up from 2 of 4 previously.",3.6

Utica Bread is awesome for breakfast.Not too far off interstate 90, no wait during our visit. Convenient access to a yummy sandwich shop, large supermarket with a bathroom, and a fast food restaurant.I think I've used this supercharger four times now and the directions the onboard navigation gave me have never been correct.  You can see the charging stations to your left from Leland Ave, but you cannot take a left turn into the shopping center from that street as the navigation instructs; you have to continue past the shopping center to Auert/Herkimer and take a left at the light to get to the main entrance.  However, I've never approached this charger from the Thruway, so those directions might be better.  The station itself is well lit but it's around the corner of the building so you car will not be visible from any of the businesses in the plaza.  I also find it a little pricey, but probably just compared to charging at home.  The plaza has a Price Chopper supermarket that's open until 11PM so I assume there are no restrooms or other amenities late at night.  There are, however several convenience stores within walking distance which may be open all hours.  On the topic of amenities: if you're charging or just stopping for a while, be sure to eat at the North End Pizza and Tap a few doors down from the Price Chopper.  Their pizza and Utica Greens are great.Not much here unless you need hearing aids or a supermarket. There's a Walgreens too",4.0

Driving through but Jackson looks like a nice town to check out in the future. In the Whole Foods parking lot because, of course. EV friendly organic eco-conscious hippies. :) Pretty sure most people here are coming in or out of Teton/Yellowstone.Nice super charger. Whole Foods is always clean and has good stuff. Well lit.  Only negative is other cars will sometimes park in spotsFour of the eight stations had non-EVs occupying them when we got there. Closer inspection showed that 30 minute general parking is allowed for alternate stalls, but while we were charging (7/11/22), the store updated signage such that all eight superchargers are allowed for 30 minute general parking. So basically, you can't trust the number of open stalls indicated by app or nav system. Tesla should consider finding a more reliable location in Jackson. It's a busy parking lot and forming a line is not a good option. If you need to use it, off hours are likely advisable.I was getting range anxiety as we got closer to the super charger and I was worried about finding a spot and about how fast it would charge because of the previous reviews. Fortunately we found a spot. It charged quickly and it was a good experience. I took 1 start off though because as mentioned in other reviews there are more non electric cars parked here than those that need it. There were plenty of normal spots open but apparently they all prefer the Tesla parking. 1 guy parked here and then went into the apartments behind the store. Lame.Seconding what others have said about this location. I was in Jackson for a week and probably used this charging station 10x. Out of those 10x, there was a gas truck parked in a Tesla spot about 30% of the time, which is lame considering there were plenty of open general parking spots at the time.  Otherwise the location is great - just outside the town square, in a Whole Foods parking lot, and a very short walk to Cowboy Coffee where you can get coffee, tea, drinks, snacks and burritos.",3.8

As other reviews mention, a few spots are “30 minute general parking” but there were still plenty of ICE vehicles parked in the “vehicle charging only” spots.  Maybe avoid this charger if you are not willing to take the chance.The place is constantly full of ICE cars. There are 2 spots that are 30min parking for everyone, the rest are for charging only. That doesn't matter, I was here several times over a couple days and it was always the same. The cars do not care about the signs. There was plenty of empty parking nearby without chargers but walking 10 extra steps would be a violation of their personal beliefs.  As for options nearby, besides the HyVee there isn't a ton around, but I walked to T.C.'s Referee about a block and a half away for lunch and that place was surprisingly good.  As for charging when we were low on battery we were able to hit about 116kW so we had no issues with the actual charging.  Overall, I think that having the chargers further out into the parking lot is a better solution to prevent other cars from parking in the spots.5 stars for the supercharger, 1 star for the locals that love to block access with their ICE vehicles. Be prepared for 1-3 stalls taken up by normal cars at all times.

The machines at Walmart in South Portland are the most unreliable I have ever seen. Even on a warm day, the 350kWH chargers on an 800V car rarely push out even close to 200kWH. Most days, you're lucky to get 100kWH. That's if you can get them to work! Most times, 2 out of 4 are broken.1st time here. Sat in pub.. Lobster sub is awesome! Service was great!Charging is good. A little under charge on one but otherwise no issues. Cost per kWh not duration. There are four chargers, so it’s busy on holiday weekends… could use more stations.",3.4

(With other chargers--particularly Electrify America--you don't find out one is unavailable until you've already pulled into a spot.) The Black Bear diner is just across the road for dining-in or take-out while charging. The only thing that could be improved is the short charge cable--a bit difficult to reach the Chevy Bolt charge port.Rates are high. Almost 30 cents per kw. You must have an account to use the charger. My charge point charge card rarely works first time to start the charge. The worst part is... When you are done charging and want to quit you CANNOT press the Done button on screen. This seems to be specific to the chargers run by Pacific Power. The protective screen is so thick it doesn't register finger presses. So either you need to stop charging in the app or call the 1800 number. Which by the way, the 1800 number isn't printed on the machine. There is also no stop charging button on the machines either besides the untouchable touch screen. So over all the charge point stations run by Pacific Power suck.The first reliable 50kW DCFC east of the Cascades! A definite stop enroute to Bend for any Chevy Bolt driver coming from Portland!Never so happy to use this charger. We arrived with only 1 mile left on our 2022 Mustang Mach E .

I've been a proud Tesla owner since 2015 and an investor since before then. I love what they're doing but they can do better here.  I fully understand that there are busy holiday times but this was not a busy holiday. This was a Monday night on a non-holiday weekday. Yes, it was the evening when everyone leaves the park but that's very predictable and we need more superchargers.

If you're not getting 100+ kW and the only car there and not near 80% try it. Also the guy complaining being limited to 80%, it does that if it's busy but you can still adjust it to 100%. They just want to get the line moving but you can override it.I wish there were a slightly more convenient restaurant and rest room than the McDonald's.

Unfortunately these are set up with diagonal parking, with the station at the end of the stall (instead of next to your car) which makes it difficult connect if you don't have a front-facing connector.

I don't have the right adapter for the fast charger which was $5. to connect. There are no chargers up and down 35 from the cities nor from here to WI along HWY 8.Stopped here on the way to and from northern Wisconsin. Both times the charger was in use when we arrived. Had to wait approximately 30 minutes for the fast charger. Used one of the 2nd level chargers while we waited for the fast charger to free up. There aren't a lot of other fast charging options nearby at the time of writing this (July 2021) so it's a popular spot. There is a pretty butterfly garden to look at, and there is a city park about a block away as well as a Casey's gas station within walking distance.We stopped here on July 3rd to add 15-20 minutes worth of charge time from the level 3 CCS charger to our 2020 Kona Ev ultimate so we could make it to Hayward, WI and then ultimately back to this charger to top off on our way home on July 4th. Likely due to the holiday weekend and sunny weather, we did encounter a shiny new fully electric Mustang charging when we arrived. There are ample level 2 J-1772 connectors here if you find the level 3 charger occupied. The level 2 chargers showed anywhere from 7.5 - 11KW in which was nice to add even a few miles to our battery while we waited for the Level 3 to open up. The mustang driver noticed we must've been waiting for the L3 charger and since they were just topping off while they had some time they cleared out and let us charge. Station worked great to quickly add some miles before we ventured to a friend's cabin in Hayward which is around 120 miles away.  We stopped again just to get enough miles to drop our friend off at home in Uptown Minneapolis and then make it home to our house in New Hope. Again, there was a wait for the Level 3 charger but we were able to add some miles on the Level 2 while we waited. The level 3 ultimately worked great again once it was available.  Bonus: there are 3 Pokémon Go Pokestops in spinning distance of the chargers plus a beautiful field of flowers and tall grass planted for butterflies and pollinators. There's also a bike/walking trail nearby and a handful of local stores and a Casey's general store within a few blocks so you don't necessarily need to sit and wait to charge if you want to go for a short walk.This location Have Tesla supercharger, otherwise we would have stranded.

There is no reason to charge with the J1772 plug here unless the Volta station nearby is full or you plan on charging longer than 2 hours. The CCS cables here aren't very long, so if your charging port is in the rear of your vehicle I would suggest backing into the charging stall. The cables here are also exceptionally bulky and heavy because they are liquid cooled. The liquid cooling is needed to keep the cables from getting too hot at the high charging rates this station is capable of producing. The pricing here is standard Electrify America rates for Oregon. A word of warning to users having issues with getting a charge to start here: The cables are very heavy and don't always make a perfect connection with some cars like the Chevy Bolt. This causes a connection error at the start of the charge. The solution is to hold up gently on the CCS cable and activate charging in the app while continuing the gentle upward pressure on the cable until the charging starts. This is indicated by a green blinking light on the Bolt dash.This is a great charging location, with convenient amenities nearby and fast access from 84 so you can get back on the road.

The landscaping is actually one of my favorite things about the Cannery District - it is unusual in that it uses a lot of native and drought tolerant plants that provide something interesting to look at every month of the year - far more beneficial to wildlife and aesthetically pleasing than the usual boring river rock and homogenous row of bushes that you see everywhere.

The app PlugShare has been a lifesaver for finding alternatives and is very user friendly. The chargepoint charger by tofurkey hq is a much better option.  The phone call required to start up Webasto stations as a non-member tends to take a full 10 minutes every time - other brands’ stations (blink, chargepoint, Volta) do not require a call to start, so having to call and wait on hold seems like a pretty unnecessary hassle.  Webasto are also the only brand of chargers that has been unreliable for me - today, this charger did not work, and I had one instance elsewhere where the charger inexplicably timed out. In both cases, calling customer service to troubleshoot was pretty frustrating - today, the rep insisted the problem was my car and not the station, even though 2 other brands of stations had worked for me in the past day. Immediately after our call I drove to a chargepoint station which worked successfully, so I followed up and informed Webasto that the problem was indeed their charger, not my car.  I am hoping Webasto addresses this issue - this location is so convenient and I’d love to charge here.

For beginners, they advertise as up to 350Kwh CCS charging stations, though in reality and to my disappointment charging loads were a mere 24-26Kwh which increased charging times 20% to 30%, which ate away at our planned travel times.  We also had a hard time verifying our car... Activating the charging station and starting the charging process, at the end of the day after using 4 Petro-Canada charging station we moved to Flo/Electric Circuit stations and we were able to resume one way without more hiccups.

I had planned a route to Salem for my nephew's 2nd birthday. I was excited because this was a new charger and was just the right distance to make it only 3 charging stops, instead of 4. I planned it out the night before, charged at my first stop just fine, got here with 6 miles left of range and tried to charge but it wouldn't connect with my car. Tried the other station and the same thing. Called the help number on the printed out piece of paper taped to the charger and he tried resetting the machine. The guy on the other end was nice and helpful, but ultimately we couldn't get it to connect and decided something was incompatible with the the software or hardware between the Spark EV and the charger. Thankfully I brought my level 1 charger and could slowly leech off the outlet at the park shelter nearby. I was able to get enough to get me to the next closest charger.  What was supposed to be a 20 min stop ended up being over 2 hours. We were going to be too late for the party so my family and I just decided to go back home. I have to now check with my credit card because trying to get it to charge put so many $30 holds on it that my credit card stopped working.  The charger in general is okay. The location is good, but I can't see how this is the future for everyone. You have to be quiet strong to manage the thick heavy charging cable. It's much more difficult to plug it in than to use a gas pump or even other fast chargers I've used. I couldn't imagine some of my older relatives having the wrist strength to operate it. And then what? There's no one to help you. It's also not covered, so bring an umbrella if it's raining. I was super excited to use this new charger, because it's been sometimes difficult for someone with a low-range, fast charging EV to get down to Portland and Salem in a reasonable time, but I guess my 7-year old car is too old? This can't be the future of driving.Works great! Google Maps does have it in the wrong location though.Very convenient and helpful",4.0

The next parking lot over has a Target and a planet fitness where you can do your shopping and get a quick workout and if needed, assuming you have a membership.

A proper coffee shop nearby and a cleaner parking lot would be nice.  Chargers are new in 2022.

Cons: one of the two 350kw chargers was out of service (both 100kw chargers were working and free though), the EVgo interface is not the most intuitive but it's easy enough once you get signed up and have the card, cost is a little high.

I'm not positive if the charging station is what constitutes the speed of the charge, or your battery, or your vehicle's charging system. This one seems to be charging just as well as any other we have used.  Straightforward and simple to use no extra gadgets or doohickeys or buttons to push. It's safe to use. Rather idiot proof. I don't think you could injure yourself if you tried. My daughter has one of them new mustangs. She has used it a few times. I think she prefers this one to the others in town.  Not sure if it relates to the charger or to the convenient shopping nearby.Had difficulty getting the charger to start working. After it started went into do some shopping came back out and found that the charger had faulted with only gaining a 10% of charge.Easy access and seldom full plus it's in a shopping mall so there's plenty to do while you're charging.What can I say, it's a charging station and everything looks brand new. I do not own a electric vehicle so I have nothing else to add.",3.4

I didn’t have trip planned. I when there for the experience.Busy, not as fast as you would think when busy.  If there’s no one here when you come by, then yes you can get a great amount of power in a short amount of time - but it’s rare that there’s not much Tesla’s here.  You can go into the Rite Aid and mess around/buy something you don’t need while you charge but, like some kind of Schrödinger’s cat situation, you only realize how slow the charger is when you get out of the car.  Overall, it’s good, but also not as quick or convenient as you’d think.Too much afternoon traffic getting to this charger - further from the highway and charger is busier than most. Several busy and slow intersections. Would recommend finding another.Awesome speed!!! I would give another star if the station was on a level surface and perhaps covered. Woo Hoo! True Supercharging! (unlike many others) I just needed enough to get 40 miles to home. But I was well under 20% charge so I added about 100 miles in about 5 minutes for $10.08. At one point the car said it was charging at over 1200 miles per hour. Would have been about 23 minutes to 80% I think. Quick turnover on charging spots. While some amenities are available there isn't much need for them when I can get the charge I need so quickly. Very happy to stop at this station.I have been here 3 times out of which 2 were after sunset. There were always homeless people hanging around the super charger area. Also both times there were cop cars patrolling the area. This is one of the great superchargers in terms of the charging speed, unfortunately not at a great location.

The machine itself didn't work for fast charging for my car or someone else's that was there, but there is no warning that it was malfunctioning so both of us continued to try to use it for a while before giving up and going to the level two chargersFirst few times we used this charger was great but this third time was a bit frustrating.  The app shows the quick charger with the CSS and CHADeMO and Tesla connectors ready and the regular chargers as out of service.  But in fact the quick 50W charger only has the CHADeMO connector working but not the CSS or Tesla connectors.  And the level 2 regular chargers were working at the charger itself but not in the app.  Luckily I had the card to tap and charge on the regular chargers but I can't check my charge levels with the app as it shows them out of service. Also the particular level 2 charger I'm using, the locking mechanism doesn't work.  It's too bad that they haven't been maintaining them. As someone visiting from out of state, the app not showing proper updated status of the chargers is very inconvenient.  Other than that, they usually work well and priced moderately, hence 2 stars this time, from 5 stars.Update (May2022): With EV adoption rate growing, as I said before, I hope more EV charging stations will be added.

Since it was below freezing with high winds, calling for help and/or problem-solving at the controls weren't viable. Conditions weren't optimal for troubleshooting. Also, the method to start charging is inconsistent on the Hydro DC chargers - what works there doesn't necessarily work elsewhere.  Luckily, another EV owner  offered to use his card. I don't know what I would have done without his help. Because it's free (a public service), people can and do help each other out - something else to consider when making decisions about $.  I don't have a Level 2 charger at my home nor do I live in Victoria so charging the car before heading up island was imperative.  I really appreciate BC Hydro intentionally installing and expanding EV infrastructure.  I am also grateful to the kind stranger!A great place for the EV community to congregate, but a bit off the beaten track. EV chargers need to be installed at big shopping malls so you can go shopping while your car is charging.",4.0

I'd give it 5 stars except for: A: It's up a long, steep mountain road, so it'll eat a lot of juice just getting here from Winthrop. B: The resort has a strict No Dogs policy, so we never stay there. Great place for hiking in the summer, and XC skiing in the winter. Great views.My Wife and I drove our Telsa Model Y over for a weekend stay and had good luck with the charging station provided by Sun Mountain Lodge. There are two Tesla level 2 chargers and one non-Tesla - the Tesla chargers that we used operated at 48A at 208V. We left our car charging several times while eating at one of the restaurants or out hiking. We were able to add enough range to drive around for the weekend and to make it back home in Bothell without having to stop.This is the only Tesla charging available in hundred miles radius and it didn't work for me during the Labor Day weekend (2020). I left supercharger at Burlington, WA with full charge (280 miles worth), Winthrop is 140 miles one-way, so it was a tight roundtrip with no room for error; so I visited this destination charger hoping to add 30 miles for safety. Neither of the 2 Tesla chargers worked (the charging port glowed red, and the panel said 'charging equipment fault'). The faculty at the lodge tried to reset the chargers a couple of times, but that didn't change anything.  First, the destination chargers are at the top of a mountain that's 12 miles from Winthrop, but takes 25 miles worth of battery to reach from Winthrop -- so, when you go there and the charger doesn't work, you've now wasted 25-30 miles of battery to make that trip up the hill and in vain. No one at the lodge can tell you either upfront if the chargers work or otherwise -- they won't know.  There's a third non-Tesla charger; but beware it's a 30A charger, which will charge about 17miles per hour at best.  I suggest - don't bother with this charging option unless you have a 10kWh buffer to gamble with. Instead, your best bets are some of the camping grounds (KOA for example) that lets you use 50A plugs for 5-6 hours in RV camping slots for $20 or so (of course you'd need your charging cable & adapters). In fact, the entire SR-20 stretch is a terrible idea with a Tesla right now -- until Tesla installs a supercharger in Winthrop. Hope they do soon -- it's one of the popular routes for camping/vacationing.",3.3333333333333335

It’s awesome. Supercharging was 47c per kWh on 7/1/22. Makes going from anchorage to homer and back doable.Recently I swapped out the engine and electrical system of my AMC Gremlin with that of a Tesla Model S Performance.  You may be asking why. It’s because I’m just a humble person who doesn’t like to flaunt his ridiculous wealth. When people see the Gremlin exterior, they assume it’s powered by a straight 252 engine with 200hp and not a vehicle that offers a “Ludicrous Mode” of 0-60 in 2.4 seconds. Also, gasoline is expensive and I hate purchasing it. Regardless, this specific charging station charges my Gremlin fully and satisfactorily. As an added bonus, it is all the way up in Alaska, so I get a nice long drive up from my home near the world famous Clown Motel at 521 N Main St, Tonopah, NV whenever I need a charge. Totally worth it.Cool but really how many tesla are in town??Food and ev charging!!",4.25
